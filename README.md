# Fixed-Point-Arithmetic
Fixed-point arithmetic module providing 8-bit and 16-bit operations with configurable Q-format and Test Harness for validation

## Description
This project implements performance efficient fixed point arithmetic (Add, Sub, Mult, Div) in both 8-bit and 16-bit with configurable Q-format. The main module provides a small test harness that executes a set of predefined tests for both of the 16-bit and 8-bit formats and reports PASS/FAIL for each of the tests. This includes cases covering different behaviours like normal operation, boundary handling and saturation, rounding and precision effects and failure conditions.

## Directory Structure

The directory FixedPointArithmetic contains the source code as well a Microsoft Visual Studio solution. Documentation is generated using Doxygen.
